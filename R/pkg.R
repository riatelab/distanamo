#' @description
#' This package enables the creation of what is often defined as a distance
#' cartogram. This is done by showing (on background(s) layer(s), such as the
#' territorial divisions of the study zone) the local deformations (calculated
#' using Waldo Tobler's bidimensional regression) to fit image points to
#' source points.
