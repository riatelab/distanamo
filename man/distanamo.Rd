\title{Create Distance Cartograms}
\description{
This package enables the creation of what is often defined as a distance
cartogram. This is done by showing (on background(s) layer(s), such as the
territorial divisions of the study zone) the local deformations (calculated
using Waldo Tobler's bidimensional regression) to fit image points to
source points.
