Description: This package enables the creation of what is often defined as a
    distance cartogram. This is done by showing (on background(s) layer(s), such as
    the territorial divisions of the study zone) the local deformations
    (calculated using Waldo Tobler's bidimensional regression)
    to fit image points to source points.
